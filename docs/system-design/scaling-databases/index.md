# Scaling Databases

Review the following topics before delving into this section:

- [Relational Databases](../../../highlevel/database/relational/) 
- [Non-Relational Databases](../../../highlevel/database/nonrelational/) 

There are two approaches to scaling up databases (these can be done in unison)

1. Additional redundancy (for better uptime, and preventing the loss of data)
2. Performance boost (faster writes and handling more loads)

Before we go into scaling techniques we will go over transactional models
